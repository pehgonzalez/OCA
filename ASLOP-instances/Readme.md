<h1> ASLOP Instances </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>
Each ASLOP instance contains 64% of small media items and 36% of big media items. Small and big media items are created considering a base size calculated as a function of the screen size and considering a grid composed by 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 media items, respectively. One should notice that the number of media items generated for each ASL instance is approximately 40% higher than the grid size so that the formulation has to choose among the available media items.

<p>Let <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=bs"> be the base size in a given dimension (width or height), the size of a small media item in that dimension is given by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0.7 \cdot bs + random(0.6 \cdot bs)">. That means that small media items are generated with sizes that are in the proximity of the base size by a factor of 30%. Moreover, let <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ss"> be the screen size in a given dimension, the size of a big media item in that dimension is given by <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=bs%2Brandom(ss-bs)">. That means that big media items have its size some were between the base size and the screen size.</p>
